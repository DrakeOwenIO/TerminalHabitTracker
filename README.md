# TerminalHabitTracker
Very basic habit tracker written in C++ that runs in a terminal window.

There are a lot of habit trackers out there but this one is mine. This is just probably the least user friendly one out there.

So, why is there no GUI?
More than anything, this is just a proof of concept to get the back-end up and working. 
In the future I may try to build a GUI. For now however I'm just practicing building applications in C++ and learning along the way.
